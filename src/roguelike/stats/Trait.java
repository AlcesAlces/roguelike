 * Trait type master list:
 * 0: Passive statistic
 * 1: Passive hidden stat (speed)
 * 2: Active bonus (double attack, power attack, etc)
 * 3: Passive regenerative ability
 * 
 * This is going to be an array of arrays, where the primary listing splits it
 * into a type, and the sub-listing gives a number for referencing.
